Welcome to our projects style guide

We are using Black as our Linter for this project 


NO EDITING ON THE MAIN- Branch!
-> Name of the branch should be the feature you are working on 


Variables - snake_case 
-> with meaningful names
->to the point (this_is_a_variable)
-> no single letters/numbers


Classes - single descriptive word with a capital at the start (Function)


File names - snake_case
->limit the length to 5 or less (test_functions.py)
-> Meaningful naming 


Comments
-> On a separate line above the code
-> if code is not self explanatory, add a descriptive comment 


Functions- snake_case (my_function)
-> Make sure we are designing our functions with dependancy injection in mind 


Redundant code 
-> keep any redundant functions in the file section of our team just in case we need to refer to it at a later date
